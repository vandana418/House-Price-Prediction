# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, area, location, etc. The goal is to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop an accurate regression model that can predict the price of a house using historical housing data.

## 📌 Features Considered

- Number of bedrooms & bathrooms
- Square footage (area)
- Location
- Lot size
- Year built
- Garage capacity
- And more...

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Loaded dataset (e.g., `house_data.csv`)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing relationships between features and target
   - Correlation analysis

4. **Model Training**
   - Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Train-test split
   - Cross-validation

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² score

6. **Prediction**
   - Predicting prices for new/unseen data
   - Saving the model using `joblib` or `pickle`
